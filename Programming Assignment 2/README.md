# Algorithm
- Linear Regression
# Implementation
- Execute programs with the iPython notebook
- Load and transform real, tabular data
- Compute summaries and statistics of the data
- Build a regression model using features of the data
# Implementation in detail
1. Selection and summary statistics
2. Filtering data
3. Building a regression model with several more features
4. Compute the RMSE (root mean squared error)
